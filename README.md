PMGSY Scheme prediction model using IBM cloud (watsonx.ai Studio)

Problem Statment:
Intelligent Classification of Rural Infrastructure Projects

The Challenge:
The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a flagship rural development 
program in India, initiated to provide all-weather road connectivity to eligible 
unconnected habitations. Over the years, the program has evolved through different 
phases or schemes (PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, RCPLWEA, etc.), each with potentially 
distinct objectives, funding mechanisms, and project specifications. 
For government bodies, infrastructure planners, and policy analysts, efficiently 
categorizing thousands of ongoing and completed projects is crucial for effective 
monitoring, transparent budget allocation, and assessing the long-term impact of these 
schemes. Manual classification is time-consuming, prone to errors, and scales poorly. 
Your specific task is to design, build, and evaluate a machine learning model that can 
automatically classify a road or bridge construction project into its correct 
PMGSY_SCHEME based on its physical and financial characteristics.
